* Must have good UI
* Nutrient IO to view pdfs: [https://www.nutrient.io/blog/how-to-display-a-pdf-in-react/](https://www.nutrient.io/blog/how-to-display-a-pdf-in-react/)
* React-pdf: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pdf)
* RAG with pinecone
* highlight in PDF


##### Old Brainstorm:

* ~~Mastra-ai that can go through papers and help summarize and connect to other citations~~
* react_flow for having a visualization of the paper connections
* maybe supabase for some datastore?
* deploy on vercel
